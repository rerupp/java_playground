## Synopsis

This repository holds Java code samples demonstrating different frameworks
and various language features.
 
## Motivation

I needed some place to save examples and be able to refer to them outside
a specific project.

## Installation

The examples currently reply on language features available with Java 8.
Maven can be used to build the project and will result in an executable jar
file. There are several **main** programs in the project so if you want to run
a specific main the **pom.xml** build file will need to be changed.

I use the **gitflow** workflow so code in the **develop** branch may have
bleeding edge changes that have not been released into the **master** branch.
I will do my best to add new code through feature branches but sometimes
I don't forget and slam stuff into **develop** which may not be 100% complete.

See ([https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow]())
for information about the git **gitflow** workflow.
